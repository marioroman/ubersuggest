# Company Research Tool

A CLI tool that uses LangChain, OpenAI, and Tavily to research companies and fetch their logos and recent news articles.

# Assumptions, Know Issues and Improvements.
1. No unit tests are provided
2. Only one agent was proposed for this approach to keep it simple. A more sofisticated approach could be developed using Langgraph with Multiple agents with releflection.
3. This project was developed using a "vibe coding" approach with Cursor
4. Time frame was reduced to 4 to 5 hours as indicated in the email
5. I assumed that an OpenAI key is provided, so to run this project you MUST config your OPENAI_API_KEY and TAVILY_API_KEY.

## Architecture

### AI Components
- **LangChain**: Used as the orchestration framework to manage AI workflows and chain different operations together
- **OpenAI GPT**: Powers the natural language understanding and generation capabilities
- **Tavily**: Provides real-time news and information retrieval
- **Logo.dev**: Handles company logo retrieval and processing

### Prompt Engineering
The system uses a structured ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) prompt pattern that enables the AI to:
1. Analyze company information through a step-by-step reasoning process
2. Extract key insights from news articles
3. Generate a comprehensive company summary
4. Identify potential risks and opportunities

The ReAct pattern follows this structure:
- **Thought**: The AI reasons about what to do next
- **Action**: Selects an appropriate tool to use
- **Action Input**: Provides input to the selected tool
- **Observation**: Processes the tool's output
- This cycle repeats until the AI reaches a final answer

This approach ensures:
- Transparent decision-making process
- Iterative problem-solving
- Clear audit trail of the AI's reasoning
- Structured interaction with external tools

## Setup

1. Install Pipenv (if not already installed):
```bash
pip install pipenv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
pipenv shell
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pipenv install
```

4. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here
LOGO_API_KEY=your_logo_api_key_here (There's one already provided on .env.example)
```

You'll need to:
- Get an OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/
- Get a Tavily API key from https://tavily.com/
- Get a Logo.dev API key from https://logo.dev

5. To Understand Tracing Call (Optional)
- Set up a new Project in https://smith.langchain.com/
- Get a LangSmith API Key 

## Usage

You can run the script in two ways:

1. With command line argument:
```bash
pipenv run python src/main.py --company stripe.com
```

The script will:
1. Fetch the company's logo using Logo.dev
2. Get 3 to 5 recent news articles about the company using Tavily
3. Display the results in a formatted output
